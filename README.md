# Wordle
A Discord bot to play Wordle with a custom wordlist made for the School of Environment via RTEA. Written in Python, run `bot.py` to use.

Features:
- Use a custom wordlist (upload your own .csv, case insensitive)
- Deletes messages guessing the word, and uses spoiler tags to avoid spoiling the answer for others
- Word updates every six hours
- Can be easily adapted for words of other lengths
